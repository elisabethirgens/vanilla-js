# Vanilla JS 🍦

These are my refactored exercises from Wes Bos’ [Beginner JavaScript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) course, and I am totally calling this repo **vanilla** instead of beginner because that makes me feel better. Overview of [all modules in the course](https://beginnerjavascript.com#videos)!

## Linting

```
npx eslint .
```

## Formatting

```
npx prettier --check .
```
